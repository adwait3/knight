which said "theoceanisactuallyreallydeeeepp"
first this clue didnt mean like much and i tried steghide , used a sound visualiser to get the spectogram , the ncame across a spoftware called deep sound , i figured that this was it as the clue said smth abt deep and indeed this was it. i used deepsound with the password "theoceanisreallydeeepp" and found a flag.png file.
